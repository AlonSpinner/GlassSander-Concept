# GlassSander-Concept
Sanding glass is tricky as it requires creating relative velocity in "random" directions.<br /> 
This is a concept of a machine that will do just that, between two 2D surfaces.<br />
The machine includes two spur gears of different sizes on which are attached two arms in different sizes<br />
Both arms hold the sanding piece.<br />
The analysis of this mechanism is very similar to that of a four-bar-linkage<br />
After this concept was chosen, the machine was built by friends who made their costumer extremly happy
